## Summary
They analyzed where the limit order tends to place. They quantitatively analyzed the probability density based on relative price; relative price is defined as $\delta(t):=b(t)-p(t)$ for buy orders, and vise vara.

### main result1
They obey variance-less power-law distribution.

### main result2
That series has a long memory property.

## main result3
If a large price fluctuation observed, agents tend to place their limit order far from best price.


## Comment
1. Absent of non-dimensionalization
    - They analyzed price fluctuation without considering market rule, tick-size.
    - This can be a serious problem, because power-law distribution can be generated by convolution of exponential distributions. I, therefore, analyzed my data and found there is a market whose distribution is exponential. 
    - In addition, the significant difference between their result and that of Bouchaud's suggest there might not be a universality. 
    - I think they had better analyze them individually and show the distribution of power-law exponents.
